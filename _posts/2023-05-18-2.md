# Quality Matters: Clearning and Preparing Data:
I've just played with the notebook provided with lesson 1 of the fastAI course. It was a lot of fun! I am surprised how simple to use machine learning code with fastAI.
Simply called fastAI trainer, load in a pre-trained model, tune it to fit my dataset, and that's it!

While I was playing with the notebook, I realize there was still some inaccurate predictions. I made some further investigation and found out the images gather by 
`DuckDuckGo` are not 100% accurate. For example, the search for dog images via `DuckDuckGo` can return images of dog on a shirt, or even a shadow of a dog!

Therefore, it is very important for the user to have a clean dataset for the machine to learn!!
