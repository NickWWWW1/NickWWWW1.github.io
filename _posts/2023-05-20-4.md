# Insights Gained from Building a Deep Learning Model
Embarking on the fastAI course, I ventured into the exciting realm of deep learning and had the opportunity to build my own neural network model. 

## Exploring Model Architectures:
During the course, I discovered that there is no one-size-fits-all architecture. Jeremy emphasized the signiicance of exploring various models and their capabilities.
Even with pre-trained models, there are tones of models that perform differently on the same dataset.

This opens a lot more room for user to play around and optimize the model!
