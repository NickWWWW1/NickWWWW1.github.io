# Insights Gained from Building a Deep Learning Model
Embarking on the fastAI course, I ventured into the exciting realm of deep learning and had the opportunity to build my own neural network model. 

## Exploring Model Architectures:
During the course, I discovered that there is no one-size-fits-all architecture. Jeremy emphasized the signiicance of exploring various models and their capabilities.
Even with pre-trained models, there are tones of models that perform differently on the same dataset.

![](/images/family.png "family")

The above graph shows the performance of each popular pre-trained models. From the graph, we can get a general idea of the accuracy and the training speed of each model. Typically, we want to choose something around the top-left on the graph, which is the more accurate and faster than the rest. However, this depends on the dataset that you are using. 

For example, `Levit_384` is one of the most accurate and fastest model among other image models according to the graph. However, it perfomrs badly demonstrated in the fastAI course. Therefore, do not always choose the model according to the graph! Depends on application, resent18 (less accurate but fast) is also a good choice!
