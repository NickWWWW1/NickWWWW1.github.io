# Simple functions for analysisng the performance of your model
I've just finished lesson 2 from the fastAI course, and it was intersting! 

I learned this useful command in fastAI library to show where the model get wrong prediction the most!

![](/images/confusion_2.png "confusion matrix")

This will be very handy in analysising the model I built in my assignment! 

Another useful function I learned is `.plot_top_losses()`:

![](/images/top_loss.png "images with most loss")

This command shows all the images with most loss during prediction, where loss is the penalty for a bad prediction. The higher the loss is, the worse prediction is.
I can now investigate which image my model perform the worst, and make some adjustments regarding on this!
