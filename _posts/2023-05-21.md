# # Framework vs built from scratch
For the first few lessons, I have been using pre-trained framework/model for machine learning. I have just watched the lesson about how to build a model from scratch, and I am amazed by the complexty hidden by the library provided by fastAI

There is a lot more steps to build a model from scratch. For example, setting up a simple linear, doing a gradient descent step, even training the linear model requires lines of coding and effort to build.

Building from scratch:

Using a framework:

Although it is very convenient to use the pre-trained framework, building a model from scratch provides you with complete control over every aspect of the models architecture and immplemntation. This level of customization allows you to tailor the model to specific requirements and experiment with novel approaches. Also,
developing a model from scratch deepens the understanding of the underlying algorithms and concepts. Using fastAI and PyTorch made things much easier than doing it from scratch, but it also hid away a lot of the details.
